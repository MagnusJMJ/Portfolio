# Portfolio
A display of my previous work, both physical and digital. Most of these examples are either from courses in my degree programme, Digital Design, or work from one of the related student jobs I held during said programme.

Last spring, myself and a group of four other students participated in a design challenge with (and for) Danske Bank, as part of the course Interaction Design II. The project spanned the entire semester, and was also concluded with a public expo on campus, where Danske Bank and panelists from the institute evaluated our designs. Of the examples provided in this portfolio, this is the only one not directly related to games. However, it is a very representative example of the experience I bring from the Digital Design programme. It spans hardware and software prototyping, user-, designer- and client needs, interaction, aesthetics, and values in design. In many ways, it is the most complete and bona fide design project listed here.
For this design challenge, my group and I created (and improved, over many iterations) a prototype of a novel payment solution titled Kinetix. Outwards, the prototype consisted of an acrylic case embedded in a “table” surface, with a small LCD screen protruding from it. Users would verify their payments by performing a personalized hand gesture in front of a stereo camera (Leap Motion), which would then pass the input to a simple machine learning API (Wekinator) to determine wether the correct gesture was performed. There was also an NFC token and reader, added as an additional security measure. All of these components - the Leap, Wekinator, the NFC reader, and our GUI - were controlled by a Processing script running on a laptop inside the prototype. An Arduino Uno was also used to control the NFC reader specifically.

Kinetix is not a “critical” design as such, but a functional and affirmative design that puts emphasis on the qualities of interaction, rather than more traditional parameters of success in this use context; these (mainly) being speed, efficiency and security. One could say that we were working in a very narrowly defined context, but also a very mundane one. That is why we designed Kinetix to solve a practical problem, but also to make the interaction more fun in the process.

In practical terms, our method of verifying the hand gestures was quite crude, and thus not very secure, but our design pitch included reflections on hypothetical technologies that could perform this task much better, and even differentiate between the minutiae of how one user performs a gesture, compared to another. In this sense, our prototype was a crude manifestation of a concept that could, theoretically, spill into the realm of biometric verification, by way of machine learning.
Our team won the design challenge for Digital Design (one winner was picked from every participating programme), and we have since explored the option (tentatively) of turning the project into a start-up.

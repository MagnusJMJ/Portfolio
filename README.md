A display of my previous work, both physical and digital. Most of these examples are either from courses in my degree programme, Digital Design, or work from one of the related student jobs I held during said programme.

Kinetix is a novel piece of interaction design prototyped by myself and my study-group at the time, for a comprehensive design challenge organized by Aarhus University in collaboration with Danske Bank. For this project we conducted research on a wide variety of subjects within payment and finance, as well as research on the needs and habits of potential users. The design and the physical prototype were refined over several iterations, based on sparring and feedback from our lecturers, ambassadors from Danske Bank, and on one occasion, an expert on block-chain and cryptocurrency.

Kinetix was displayed at a public expo at the Katrinebjerg campus, along with the other participating designs. Kinetix won the design challenge along with two other designs (one winner was chosen from each participating course), and received critical acclaim from both lecturers and spokespeople from Danske Bank.

## [The SCORE Suitcase](https://github.com/MagnusJMJ/Portfolio/tree/master/SCORE%20Suitcase)

This interactive suitcase equipped with sensors, speakers, and other electronics, is a physical prototype designed and built for the EU-funded smart-cities project SCORE. The purpose of the prototype is to provide a novel and communicative object to exhibit at expos and other places where the SCORE project is physically present. The prototype was first displayed at an internal SCORE stakeholder conference at Dokk1 in Aarhus, and later at SCORE's stand in Ridehuset at IoT Week 2019, also in Aarhus.

The relatively low fidelity of the prototype was both a conscious design decision, and a result of its role as a springboard for a more refined iteration by professional designers further down the line. The design process was fully orchestrated and executed by two student assistants; myself and Julie Neel, with a budget of less than 3000 DKK.
